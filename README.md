📈 Descriptive Statistics – Uses .describe() to summarize numerical features.

🧹 Missing Value Analysis – Identifies and possibly handles missing or null values.

📉 Visualizations – Histograms, boxplots, bar charts, and scatter plots used to explore distributions and patterns.

🔗 Correlation Analysis – Heatmap or correlation matrix used to detect relationships between variables.
